# Python Lists (Arrays)

If you want to describe the days of the week or fruits that you love, what would you do?

```python
# ❌ wrong example
fruits = "🍎"
fruits = "🍊"
fruits = "🍌"
```

That might be not a great idea, how about `fruits = "🍎", "🍊", "🍌"` or `days_of_week = "Mon, Tues, Wed, ..."`
This will not work either. Instead, we have an option for the `list`.

```python
months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May"]
fruits = ["🍎", "🍊", "🍌"]
```

If you know JavaScript, this will be familiar as an `array`. This `list` requires `[]` square brackets, and fill the inside with the data types.

## Python methods

Python has a data types like `string` and `int`. Methods are the functions that bond to the data types.

```python
print("Hello world") # function
name = "Luis"
print(name)
name.upper() # method
print(name)
```

Can you see the difference? Python data types has it's built-in functions that allow developers to use.

> _check out the documentation if you are interested._ > https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str

To try methods, write the data type and put `.` next to it, and you will see the availble methods.

❗methods are connected to the data type, so it cannot be used by itself. `print()`, `int()` these are functions, not methods.

```python
name = "Philip"

print(name.capitalize()) # ✅

print(capitalize()) # ❌
```

## List `.append()`

Take back to our list.

```python
half_year = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May"]
fruits = ["🍎", "🍊", "🍌"]
```

If you want to add something in your list, use `.append()` method.

```python
print(half_year)
print(fruits)
half_year.append("June")
fruits.append("🍈")
print(half_year)
print(fruits)
```

![Alt text](</images/2023-03-01-python_05/Screen Shot 2023-03-01 at 5.24.26 PM.png>)

It appended `June` and `melon` to the lists!

## Indexing

Now, you maybe want to use the items of the list. But `print(fruits)` returns the whole list.
That where the python indexing comes.

```python
fruits = ["🍎", "🍊", "🍌", "🍈"]
# To get banana
print(fruits[2])
# To get orange
print(fruits[1])
# To get apple
print(fruits[0])
# To get the last item of the list
print(fruits[-1])
```

As you can check with the example above, **indexing** is a way to refer individual items from the list by its position.

❗Caution, in programming, indexing starts with `0` not `1`.
If you want to get first item of the list, `list[0]` is correct.

```python
my_list = ["first", "second", "third", "fourth", "last"]
0 1 2 3 4 ... 👉 # index 0 to ...
# my_list[0] == "first"
-4 -3 -2 -1 ... 👈 # index -1 to ...
# my_list[-1] == "last"
```

`List` can contain all the data types we have learned previous.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "first", "second", "third", [11, 22, 33, ["Hi I'm nested list", "hello"]], True, False]
```

## Slicing

We learned how to get the individual item from the list. But what if you want multiple items? The answer is slicing.

```python
fruits = ["🚗", "🍊", "🍌", "🍈", "🍹"]
```

Let's bring our fruits list again. There are some items that is not fruit. To get only fruits, do this.

```python
fruits = ["🚗", "🍊", "🍌", "🍈", "🍹"]
print(fruits[1:4])
"""
>> result should be ['🍊', '🍌', '🍈']
"""
```

There are couple things you need to check.

```python
fruits[1:4]
```

The first number `1` is where you want to start slicing. The second number `4` is where you want to stop slicing.

```python
fruits = ["🍎", "🍊", "🍌", "🍈", "🍹"]
print(fruits[0:4])
```

If our `fruits` list contains apple, the slicing would be start at `0`. It is a bit confusing, but it is helpful.

Another thing we need to know about slicing is how we can reverse the list.

```python
fruits = ["🍎", "🍊", "🍌", "🍈", "🍹"]
print(fruits[0:4:1])
```

Same as we do for slicing, add one more column, and that will decide the reading direction and step.
For example, `fruits[0:5:2]` will return `['🍎', '🍌', '🍹']`

```python
fruits = ["🍎", "🍊", "🍌", "🍈", "🍹"]
print(fruits[0:4:1]) # 1 is default
print(frutis[0:5:2]) # `['🍎', '🍌', '🍹']`
print(fruits[::-1])
# returns ['🍹', '🍈', '🍌', '🍊', '🍎']
```

The last `print`, we didn't write anything for start and stop value, but step. As you can see the result, it reverses the list because the step value has changed to `-1`.

Try couple more slices so you can get familiar with slice and reverse.

```python
print(fruits[::-2])
print(fruits[1::-1])
print(fruits[:-3:-1])
print(fruits[-3::-1])
```

## Tuples

### Mutable / Immutable

Before we dive in to tuples, we need to step back for mutable and immutable.

```python
days = ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday")
fruits = ["🍎", "🍊", "🍌", "🍈"]
```

As you know if we want to use some ordered sequence of values, the `list` comes in. But what if we want the list but don't want to change the value?

```python
days = ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday")
days. # check this in your terminal
```

❗To summarize, **mutable** means you can modify the value after your created the data, and **immutable** means you cannot modify the data.

### Tuple

The `tuple` is a list but cannot modify values inside. Remeber if we put `.` after the datatypes we can see the methods? Same as `list`, `tuple` has methods, but cannot `.append()` or `.pop()`.

![Alt text](</images/2023-03-01-python_05/Screen Shot 2023-03-01 at 9.45.40 PM.png>)

Same point with the `list` is indexing, which is the way of reading items in the `list/tuple`.
