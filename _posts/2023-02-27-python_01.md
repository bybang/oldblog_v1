# Hello World with Python

## Intro

## Print "Hello world"

Similar to Javascript, python has a code to show the result in the console; `print()`

```python
print("Hello world!");
```

In python, variables can be stored in text like name, age... Also, you can use print function ex) `print(your_variable)`

```python
name = "your_name"
age = 20
```

Each programming language has a unique style of writing. In JavaScript, `yourName = "Dave"` we call this camel case. In python, we use an underscore to divide the text like `your_name = "Dave"`
we call this **snake case**

To store multiple values in multiple variables, you can also do the following. That will be the same result as above.

```python
name, age = "your_name", 20
```

Why do we want to store data in variables? Because we don't want to put data everytime when we run the program.

```python
print("Hello I'm John I'm 20 years old")
print("Hello I'm Jane I'm 20 years old")
# do this instead
print("Hello I'm " + name + " I'm " + age + " years old")
```

Variable names can be anything, but they cannot have the numbers before the variable names.
`var = 1 , name2 = 'something' ✅`
`12var = 1, 2name = 'Elise' ❌`

To ask a user input from the terminal, we can use `input()` function

```python
input("What is your name: ")
```

Let's make a simple input that takes the user name and prints with a greeting.

```python
user_name = input('Please enter your name: ')
print('Hello ' + user_name)
```

> To run .py file in your terminal, type `python your_file.py` from your terminal.

## DATA TYPES (string, number)

### Strings

Python has many data types, such as strings, integers, booleans, etc. Let's talk about string type. The string is simply text data.

As you see from the above (`name = "your_name"`) string should be inside of a **quote**.

Try this from your terminal

```
name = your_name
name = "your_name"
name = 'your_name'
```

String is a text data type that resides in **quote**(double or single quotes).

### Numbers(int, float)

Also, python has number data types.
`int` is short for an integer which is a whole number.
`float` is a floating number which is a number with a decimal point.

Try

```
num1 = '2'
num2 = '3'
print(num1 + num2)
```

What happened? It concatenates two strings together.

You can assign numbers in variables without the quotes `num1 = 2 , num2 = 3` or use a function `int()`

```
num1 = '2'
num2 = '3'
print(int(num1) + int(num2))
```

For now, just understand that the `int()` function takes a string number and returns an integer number value.

### Boolean

This data type represents True or False state.
Let's say we're building a game. If we want to represent the status of a character that is alive, then we do

```python
character_alive = True # alive
character_alive = False # dead
```

The important part of boolean is they start with a capital letter `True or False` not `true or false`

## Baby Tip Calculator

**_Tip Calculator App_**

For the exact dollar and cents calculation, we use `float()` function instead of `int()` function.

```python
food_amount = float(input("Enter Food Amount $: "))
tip_percentage = float(input("Enter your tip percentage %: ")) / 100

# how much am I paying in total?
tip_amount = food_amount * tip_percentage
total = food_amount + tip_amount

print('$ ' + str(total))
```

Let's go a little fancy to show the result in the terminal.

##### F-strings

If we want to use a python expression inside the string constants(inside of the quotes), do this.

```python
name = James
print(f"Hi my name is ${name}")
```

Using `${}` inside of the quotes helps you use python code inside the string.

And the result turned to follow.
Run the code in your terminal and see the difference.

```python
...

# print('$ ' + str(total))

print('\n\n')
print('=================================')
print(f'🍗 Food Amount: ${food_amount}')
print(f'💸 Tip Amount: ${tip_amount}')
print('\n')
print(f'💰 Total Amount: ${total}')
print('=================================')
```
