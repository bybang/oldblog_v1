# Full Stack Development with Java Spring Boot, React, and MongoDB â€“ Full Course

### This is the course from freeCodeCamp to learn Java with react

> You can find the video on YouTube here:

# ðŸ§© Problem

## Spring setup

Now, let's initialize the spring project. Go to `start.spring.io`, and select Maven project. Choose the language you wish to use and the corresponding Spring Boot version.

> **Maven** is a build automation tool used primarily for **_Java_** projects

The group is the reversed domain format. If you have your domain address, use it here, or you can name any domain name as long as that domain is not taken.

Artifact is the project's name, and type the description for your project.

JAR stands for Java Archive. JAR files contain libraries, resources and accessories like property files. It is widely used for packaging and distributing standalone Java applications.

WAR stands for Web Application Archive and is used for web applications. Since it contains web applications like JSP, HTML and Javascript, it can be deployed on any servelt/JSP container.

JAR is more commonly used for Spring Boot projects, and the instructor used it for that reason.

Select the corresponding Java version that you installed previously.

### Dependencies and Generate

Unlike VScode, we will install dependencies in this page and add up if needed.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/7c58c279-9fda-4c6d-96cb-5bbd5c539401/image.png)

After adding the required dependencies, click the generate. Once the initializer generates the file, open the IntelliJ IDEA and the file we generated. (Click the Trust Project)

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/d50586b8-f856-4094-bb39-832529359af7/image.png)

### Folder and Basic file structure

It is similar to React, but let's briefly skim through the folder structure.

Maven manages the `.mvn` folder, and we will not touch it in this project.

The `src` folder or source folder contains `main` and `test`.

The `main` folder is where all the logic and algorithms lie. The `test` folder is where the developer writes the testing codes. The instructor did not write the testing code because of the course difficulty.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/d7de5ff7-178f-409a-860f-704f2bd90fe6/image.png)

Inside of `MoviesApplication`, it contains about ten lines of codes, and I'll skim these codes.

The first line, `package - ` declares a self-explanatory package.

The next part is the `import - part. SpringApplication ` has the method `.run()`.

To start the spring application, we have to call the `.run()` method and, pass the application class(MoviesApplication) and pass some command line arguments(args).

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	SpringApplication.run(MoviesApplication.class, args)
}
```

The second `import` statement is importing the `SpringBootApplication` annotation.

In `Java`, annotations are used to let the compiler know what this `class` does.

## Run Java file

Let's run this code to see if we have anything on the browser by `ctrl + R` for Mac users.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/ff3856ca-202d-4bf2-be1e-d67aa3c23dae/image.png)

You will encounter the following error, which is correct since we haven't yet connected to the `mongoDB`.

It is okay to leave it like that or go to `pom.xml` and comment on the `mongoDB` part if you wish to eliminate the error.

> If you commented out or made any changes to `pom.xml`, reload the project. Right-click `pom.xml` - maven - reload or shortcut key.

After the setting, run the file again and go to `localhost:8080`.

You will see the following page.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/70ef6def-359c-4ca4-b3a4-6abf9220b844/image.png)

This white page means there is no endpoint. Although we have an API, there is no API to hit.

We will add `RestController`, the annotation that lets the framework know this class is a `REST API Controller`.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/ac80731c-74f7-4d62-ad2a-fe89e8b39625/image.png)

The `GetMapping` lets the framework know the following method is a `GET` endpoint.

```java
@GetMapping("/")
public String apiRoot() {
	return "Hello, World!";
}
```

If you re-run the application and go to `localhost8080/root`, you will be able to see the `"Hello World!"` in your browser.

The above code is only for education purposes, and we won't make `API`s similarly.

We are going to divide the application into separate layers, which there will be a service layer, a data access layer and an API layer.

## Connect MongoDB with Java

Before jumping into the layers, we have to resolve the error we previously commented out.

In the 'resources' folder below the current folder, there is a file called `application.properties`.

We will have to write the different application properties related to this project.

For instance, we would need `spring.data.mongodb.database=` and `spring.data.mongodb.uri=` to connect a database that we created.

If you have made a React project, the `.env` structure will be familiar to you. If not, we would need the structure shown in the below picture.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/f5ec0e7a-517f-469d-ae84-d1601845e3ca/image.png)

We will have the `.env` file and `.env.example` for later reference.

We need to install a new dependency to use the `.env` file in Maven. Search Maven dependency or go to the website below and search for the `spring dotenv`.

> https://mvnrepository.com/

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/0c55faf1-8dfd-4215-8fb3-7da133916d78/image.png)

At the end of the dependency lists, we will add a new `<dependency>`. You can find the `groupId` and `artifactId` under the search bar.

Although we don't have to define the version, if you wish, you can select the version. Choose the version you want to install and add it to the version tag.

Reload the maven and check if `mongoDB` is connected to your Java file.

# ðŸŽ¯ Project Set up

## Movies and Reviews

In our application, there are two types of data that we are going to work with.

We will need to create separate classes to represent these two entities.

### Movie Setup

In IntelliJ, we can decide if this file works as a class, interface or annotation.

Before we create another logic, we will make the document for the `mongoDB` since it is a document based database.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/318bfacd-fc9f-40b9-bdfc-48ffe2295e1f/image.png)

Foremost, we have to define or annotate this class as a document. Add the following code to do so.

```java
@Document(collection = "movies")
```

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/0968b5ab-a4e9-41ee-b242-0e73aea57969/image.png)

This will let the framework know that this class represents each movie collection. We can decide on the collection name in the parentheses.
`(collection = "movies")`

Inside this `Movie` class, we will have private data with the same property names as `mongoDB`.

We need to annotate the `ObjectId` as an actual ID with `@Id`.
This will let the framework know that the `private ObjectId id;` property should treated as a unique identifier for each movie inside of the database.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/484d87ae-6671-4aab-bb4c-8da6d6493a88/image.png)

If your `List` is in red, you have to import the `List` class from `util`.

Compare with `mongoDB` and check if necessary property names are missing.

After adding all the private data, we need to add `getters` and `setters` for the `String` methods and some constructors.

That is the time when our handy tool `Lombok` comes.

`Lombok` is an annotation-based Java library tool that allows the reduction of the boilerplate code.

In Vanilla Java code, the code for a user will be like this.

```java
public class User {
	private int id;
    private String name;
    private String address;

    public int getId() {
    	return id;
    }

    public void setId(int id) {
    	this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
    	return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
    	this.name = name;
    }

    public String getAddress() {
    	return address;
    }

    protected void setAddress(String address) {
    	this.address = address;
    }
}
```

With `Lombok`, we can reduce these lines of code as below.

```java
@Getter
@Setter
public class User {
	private int id;
    private String name;
    @Setter(AccessLevel.PROTECTED)
    private String address;
}
```

> Since this is not a post for `Lombok`, I won't write details of it.

Hence, instead of writing the `getter` method in each `String`, we can add `@Data`. This will take care of all different `getters` and `setters`.

Also, we will add `@AllArgsConstructor`. This annotation means the `Lombok` automatically generates a constructor and will generate the constructor with one parameter for each field in your class.

When the class is annotated with `@NoArgsConstructor`, The `Lombok` generates a constructor without parameters.

```java
public class Movie {
    ...
    private String imdbId;
    private String title;
    private String releaseDate;
    ...

    // @NoArgsConstructor
    public Movie() {}

    // @AllArgsConstructor
    public Movie(..., String imdbId, String title, String releaseDate, ...) {
      ...
      this.imdbId = imdbId
      this.title = title
      this.releaseDate = releaseDate
      ...
    }
}
```

We will look for more details on `reviews` in the next section.

After adding all of the required fields, your Java file will look like below:

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/30da6a2c-e8fa-4aaf-8be0-ff9f9532b95b/image.png)

### Review Setup

Review is also a document, but we didn't create the `review` collection on `mongoDB` yet.

It works the other way around because we can write the code in a Java file first and then create the collection.

We will have two private properties similar to the `Movie` collection.

The first is a unique identifier, and the second is a `body`, which we will get from the user.

Name this collection as `reviews`, and add the required properties and annotations. If you follow along, your code will be similar to this except for the last constructor.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/5b509913-9d3e-4516-9197-3db22ca0837d/image.png)

Now it's time for the `reviews` from the `Movie` class.

As we see from the database, each single `movie` has an array of `reviews`. We can add `private List<Review> reviews;` at the bottom, similar to the previous properties.

This is an embedded relationship since we have the `Movie` and `Review` models. It means all the reviews related to the `Movie` will be added to the list of `reviews`.

This structure is good to go, as we are modelling a `one to many` relationship because one movie can have multiple reviews. But since this is a Spring Boot course, the instructor explained the `@DocumentReference`.

The `DocumentReference` function acts as a mapping layer and extracts the `id` from the `<Reivew>` class, which is the referenced entity storage, and loads the referenced document on read.

This is why the instructor explained to store `ids` of the `reviews` and those `reviews` are in separate collections.

> More info on https://spring.io/blog/2021/11/29/spring-data-mongodb-relation-modelling

We will go over more details about the constructor when we create the `createReivew` method. Also, we will learn how to make a custom constructor that takes the `body` of the review.

# ðŸ“Œ Takeaway

Through this post, I learned about

- how to create and connect the `mongoDB` collections with Java.
- setting up the Spring Boot project with initializer was refreshing because I mostly created react projects through the terminal until now.
- unlike VScode, IntelliJ requires to install dependencies manually with Maven(at least in this course)
- Java needs an Application file to run, which is similar to App.js in React.
- A basic feature of Lombok and relation modelling manual references.

# ðŸ’» Solution

- None

# ðŸ”– Review

- The Spring Boot project uses a spring initializer for the boilerplate codes. Customization for dependencies, names, and Java and Spring Boot versions are allowed here.

- Maven is a build automation tool used for Java projects, but for modern projects, gradle is preferred because of its performance.

- Jar stands for Java ARchive, and War stands for Web Application aRchive. Jar is more commonly used for Spring Boot projects.

- Similar to the React project's `App.js`, Java has the `Application` file, and by running this file, we can see the app in the browser.

- When editing `pom.xml`, the Maven-reload is required.

- The `env` settings are the same as the React, but the `.env` files and `application.properties` reside in the `resources` folder.

- The `mongoDB` is a document-based database, so each `Movie` and `Review` should have `@Document` annotation. This annotation can have the collection name property
  `@Document(collection = "movies")`

- Lombok is a Java library tool that minimizes/reduces the boilerplate code and saves time for developers.

- We can remove many lines of code by using `@Data`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, and `@NoArgsConstructor`.

- Relation modelling for manual reference can vary, and the point of use is to get all the reviews from the `Review` and use it as a reference to save and edit the reviews in `Movie`. Also, reviews are stored in a separate collection.
