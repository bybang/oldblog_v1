# Higher Order Functions

Python has a higher order functions, and we will go through `.map()` and `.filter()` in this post.

We call higher order function which can take another function as a parameter or argument. In higher order function, we can return a function as a result of another function.

## `.map()`

`.map()` is a function that works as an iterator. It returns a new list after applying a function to every item in the list.

```python
'''
From the previous post
>>> double([1, 2, 3])
2, 4, 6
'''
```

Do you remember exercises that we did in previous post? The function `double()` takes a list of numbers and returns doubled numbers.

There is more simple way of doing this with `.map()`

```python
def double_number(number: int) -> int:
  return number * 2

print(list(map(double_number, [1, 2, 3])))
```

`.map()` takes two argument, one is a `function` and another one is `list` in this case.

Also we can refactor this with `lambda`

```python
print(list(map(lambda number: number * 2, [1, 2, 3])))

# To return squared value, we can use **
print(list(map(lambda number: number ** 2, [1, 2, 3])))
```

## `.filter()`

`.filter()` is a method that tests each element in the given object to be true or not with the given function.

For example, if we want to get even numbers from the list, we can use `filter`.

```python
numbers =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

# Modulo operator
# it divides by given number and returns remainder

# how to check for EVEN number
# 2 % 2 == 0
# 4 % 2 == 0
# 6 % 2 == 0

print(list(filter(lambda number: number % 2 == 0, numbers)))
```

We reused structure above, with the filter function. This time, we passed numbers `list`, not the list itself.

# List Comprehensions

Can you believe that their is more efficient way to doing this? Well, that is the time for list comprehensions.

First, let's take a look for the example of a list comprehension.

```python
numbers =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

[number for number in numbers if number % 2 ==0]
```

Wow, what is going on here? To break down, we have to sperate this to three parts.

The first part is returning list `number`
The second part is a loop `for number in number`
The third part is a condition `if number % 2 == 0`

And when we print the list comprehension above, we will get the same result with `print(list(filter(lambda number: number % 2 == 0, numbers)))`

```python
# filter and return only EVEN numbers
numbers =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

print([number for number in numbers if number % 2 == 0])

# result
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Now it is time for `.map()`

```python
# map - double the numbers
print([number * 2 for number in numbers])
```

It is much simpler than using `.map()`!

> ❗ Review for list comprehension
>
> 1. The first argument in list comprehension asks how should we build the list.
> 2. The second argument is the loop part.
> 3. The third argument is the conditional and it is optional.

Easy practice ❗

##### **Tiny Tip**

Using list comprehension is generally easier than using `.map()` and `.filter()`
