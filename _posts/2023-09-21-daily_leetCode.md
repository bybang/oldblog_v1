# ðŸŽ¯ Strategy

### Two approaches

As always, I tried two different ways to solve this problem. The first approach is the arithmetic approach, and the second approach is the stack approach.

### Arithmatic apporach

Once we see the example carefully, we can derive a mathematical expression.

```python
# Pseudocode
'''
summing the arithmatic series, S(n)
S(n) = n / 2 * { 2a + (n - 1)d }
where n is number of terms to add,
a is the first term
d is the common difference between terms
Hence,
'''
result = (k / 2) * (2 * maxNum + (k-1)*1)
```

If we choose to use the sum of the arithmetic series formula, we must consider the decimal point.

```python
 def maximizeSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
 	return trunc((k/2) * (2 * max(nums) + (k-1)))
```

The time complexity is `O(1)`, and the space complexity is `O(1)`.

### Stack approach

I solved this problem using the stack approach, which I practiced a lot when attending the Goormthon challenge.

First, we define a `maxNum` from the list and will iterate k times since k is the operation number.

Now, we will define stack as the empty list and append the current `maxNum`. After appending the current `maxNum`, we will add one to `maxNum`

Make a variable `result`, and while stack exists, add `current` to the result(which is the current `maxNum`).

This for-loop will iterate three times and break. After the iteration, we will return the result.

```python
 def maximizeSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
 	maxNum = max(nums)
    result = 0

    for _ in range(k):
    	stack = []
    	stack.append(maxNum)
        maxNum += 1

        while stack:
        	current = stack.pop()
            result += current

    return result
```

The time complexity is `O(n)`, and the space complexity is `O(1)`.

# ðŸ“Œ Thoughts

I tried to use the stack method since I practiced a lot, but there was a more clever way to do this. I didn't know the sum of the arithmetic series formula, but I tried to learn the formula by Google search.

I'm not sure if I need to keep solving easy problems or move to medium problems. I will try to solve the first five problems, and if it is too easy, I will go to the next difficulty level.

# ðŸ’» Solution

### Arithmetic approach

```python
def maximizeSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
	return trunc((k/2) + (2 * max(nums) + (k-1)))
```

### Stack Method

```python
def maximizeSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
	maxNum = max(nums)
    result = 0

    for _ in range(k):
    	stack = []
        stack.append(maxNum)
        maxNum += 1

        while stack:
        	current = stack.pop()
            result += current
	return result
```
