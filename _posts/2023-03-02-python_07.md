# Python Sets

Another intersting data type is `set`. A `set` is an unordered collection data type.

```python
list1 = ['ruby', 'python', 'javascript', 'Go']
list2 = ['ruby', 'SQL', 'javascript', 'JAVA']
```

There are two lists above. How do we join this two lists together and remove duplicates? That is the turn for `set` .

> ❗ In this examples list name is `list1` but avoid using keyword that has same name with functions
>
> For instance, `list()`, `len()`, `dict()`, and `set()`, etc...

First add two lists together `programming languages = list1 + list2`. Then use `print()` to see the result.

```python
# result
['ruby', 'python', 'javascript', 'Go', 'ruby', 'SQL', 'javascript', 'JAVA']
```

Second, we need to get rid of duplicates. Wrap the `list1 + list2` in `set()` function.

```python
list1 = ['ruby', 'python', 'javascript', 'Go']
list2 = ['ruby', 'SQL', 'javascript', 'JAVA']

programming_lang = set(list1 + list2)

print(programming_lang)
print(type(programming_lang))

# result
{'Go', 'javascript', 'SQL', 'python', 'JAVA', 'ruby'}
<class 'set'>
```

You can see it returns the data type `set`. It is not a `list`, so we cannot use indexing here. This means data type `set` is not subscriptable.

```python
print({1, 2, 2, 2}) # returns {1, 2}
print({1, 2, 2, 3, 3}[0]) # ❌
```

## Set excersice

Let's practice `set`

Create a function `unique`, that takes in a `list` and returns only unique items.

```python
'''
create a function unique, that takes in a list of languages and returns only unique items

>>> unique(['ruby', 'ruby', 'python'])
['ruby', 'python']
'''
```

  <div markdown="1">

```python
# result will vary
ex_1 = ['ruby', 'ruby', 'python']
ex_2 = ['ruby', 'python', 'Go', 'JAVA', 'Go', 'ruby']

def unique(languages):
  return list(set(languages))

print(unique(ex_1))
print(unique(ex_2))
```

  </div>
</details>

**Bonus!** Can we put the code in one line as it is short code?

It is an overkill for this function, but still it is good to practice lambda here to get familiar with it.

# Python Loops

Let's move on to most commonly used feature in programming: `Loops`

```python
fruits = ['🍎', '🍐', '🍊', '🍌', '🍓', '🍪']
```

Here is our fruits list again from the previous post. Now we want to get all the items in list, and we know that we can get the items with index.

```python
fruits = ['🍎', '🍐', '🍊', '🍌', '🍓', '🍪']
print("fruit:", fruits[0], 0)
print("fruit:", fruits[1], 1)
print("fruit:", fruits[2], 2)
print("fruit:", fruits[3], 3)
```

Try this code from your terminal. We got fruit, and idex of the fruit from the code above.

```python
# result
fruit: 🍎 0
fruit: 🍐 1
fruit: 🍊 2
fruit: 🍌 3
```

But this is not efficient enough. Imagine you are dealing with Amazon item lists or Netflix movie lists. We can't manually type every single time. And thankfully, we have a `loop` to figure this out.

## For loop

We can loop through the items of the list with `for loop`. The basic structure will be like this:

```python
for placeholder in list:
  # do something here(indented)
```

The placeholder can be anything, and usually it is a singular term of list. For example, `fruit in fruits`, `fruit` is the item and `fruits` is the list.

```python
for fruit in fruits:
  print("fruit:", fruit)

# result
fruit: 🍎
fruit: 🍐
fruit: 🍊
fruit: 🍌
```

This simple line of code saves you so much time! Now we don't have to manually type when we want to get the items.

But we are missing `index`, so let's get an index

### enumerate

There is another helpful function called `enumerate()` which returns a list of items with the indices.

Try run this code

```python
fruits = ['🍎', '🍐', '🍊', '🍌', '🍓', '🍪']

# added list() to see the result
print(list(enumerate(fruits)))

# result
[(0, '🍎'), (1, '🍐'), (2, '🍊'), (3, '🍌'), (4, '🍓'), (5, '🍪')]
```

The function `enumerate` returns a `tuple` with the according indicies.

### Unpacking tuple

Now we got the tuples, it is time for unpacking. Remeber from the previous post, `variables` can be assigned in this way

```python
name, age = "your_name", 20
```

We can apply this rule to tuple as well. First we need to have a `tuple`, and then assign the values in different `variables`.

```python
my_tuple = (0, '🍎')
index, fruit = (0, '🍎')

print(index)
print(fruit)

# result
0 # index
🍎 # fruit
```

### For loop indexing

We have a unpacked `tuple` and the `enumerate()` function. To combine these two, we need to do the following:

```python
fruits = ['🍎', '🍐', '🍊', '🍌', '🍓', '🍪']

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
  print("fruit:", fruit, index)

# result
fruit: 🍎 0
fruit: 🍐 1
fruit: 🍊 2
fruit: 🍌 3
fruit: 🍓 4
fruit: 🍪 5
```

We set the placeholder as `variable` index and fruit, and `enumerate` the array to get the list `[(0, '🍎'), (1, '🍐'), (2, '🍊'), (3, '🍌'), (4, '🍓'), (5, '🍪')]`

Each time when for loop triggers `print()`, first item of tuple will be `index(0, 1, 2, ...)` and the second item of the tuple will be the `fruit`.

### apply for loop

We can use the for loop in many different situations. One example, if we ordered five kiwis, and want to add five kiwis in the list.

```python
fruits.append('🥝')
fruits.append('🥝')
fruits.append('🥝')
fruits.append('🥝')
fruits.append('🥝')
```

That is one way to achieve the goal, but it is not DRY(Don't repeat yourself) code. So, we can use for loop in this scenario.

```python
fruits = ['🍎', '🍐', '🍊', '🍌', '🍓', '🍪']

for _ in range(5):
  fruits.append('🥝')

print(fruits)

# result
['🍎', '🍐', '🍊', '🍌', '🍓', '🍪', '🥝', '🥝', '🥝', '🥝', '🥝']
```

> ❗Reminder❗ The function `range()` returns a sequence of numbers starting from 0 by default.

## While loop

In previous post, we studied `while` statement with the number guessing game. So in this section, we are skim through it.

```python
# Watch out for infinite loop
Sam = 'sitting'

# != means not equals to
while Sam != 'standing':
  print('Stand UP!!!') # infinite loop.

counter = 0
while counter < 10:
  print(counter)
  counter += 1
```

Although we used it for the number guessing game, in general, `while loop` is not used as much as `for loop`.

As we are the beginners, using `for loop` would be a good choice to practice.
