# Python Functions 01

> This posting series is based on Python tutorials by Clever Programmer and Nomad Coder, and it aims to study two materials and provide a comprehensive explanation of fundamental concepts to beginners.

## If, else statment

Let's build some logic for very simple number guessing

```python
# number = winning_number
# If the number is right
  # then you are winner
# else
  # you are not a winner try next time
```

In CS, we call this logic build up or description of the code as **Pseudocode**

```python
#  If the number is right
  # > True or False?
  # then you are winner
# else
  # you are not a winner try next time
```

If else statement check the condition if it is true or false.
With this statement, we are going to create a weather function.

## Baby Weather APP

The logic will be following.

```python
# Takes the input about the weather
# If it is raining outside, print un umbrella
# else if cloudy, print cloud
# else if the weather with the thunderstorem, print thunderstorm
# otherwise, print sunglasses
```

If the condition is three or more, use `elif` to check condition is not fit into if or else.

```python
weather = input('What is the weather like? : ')

if weather == 'rain':
  print('☔')
elif weather == 'cloudy':
  print('☁️')
elif weather == 'thunderstorm':
  print('⚡')
else:
  print('😎')
```

### comparison operators

In python there are some comparison operators.

> (>, <, ==, <=, >=)

- single `=` is the assignment operator which assigns the value of the right side of expression to left side operand (not comparison operator)
- double `==` is checking if first varible is equals to second argument

## Baby Grades App

Let's build another app that will help to understand `if else` statement and comparison operators.

Pseudocode for baby grade checker

```python
# Put the user score
# >=90 : A
# >=80 : B
# >=70 : C
# >=60 : D
# <60 : F
```

```python
score = int(input('Put in your score here: '))

if score >= 90:
  print('A')
elif score >= 80:
  print('B')
elif score >= 70:
  print('C')
elif score >= 60:
  print('D')
else:
  print('F')
```

what about checking passing grade? Check either a SUPER PASS or passing grade or failing grade

```python
if score > 100:
  print('SUPER PASS')
elif score >= 60 and score <= 100:
  print('passed')
else:
  print('failed')
```

Instead of using `score >= 60 and score <= 100` let's use more **pythonic** code

> pythonic code : clean code in python way

```python
if score > 100:
  print('Excellent')
elif 60 <= score <= 100:
  print('passed') # pythonic
elif score < 60 or score > 100:
  print('You either failed or SUPER PASSED')
```

> If you run the code above, you will see the last line of code is not working properly.

It is because python reads from top to bottom. That means when the condition matches the first one, python excutes the code and stops there.

## And & or

If you look at the above example, we have been used `and` and `or` inside of the code. Did you feel any inconvenient reading those lines of code? Probably not, because python is a high-level programming language, which means python code is close to what human speaks. This makes python very easy programming language to read and write.

```python
True and True == True
True and False == False
False and True == False
----------------------
True or False == True
```

Remeber `and` needs both sides to be true or false. `or` needs only one side to be true.

## Functions

Let's talk about our main topic functions.
Functions make developers more productive. Function is reuseable code, and allow us choose the data input what we want to use for the result.

### Define Function

Functions has a special syntax. Write a `def` in front of the function and space. The function name cannot have the whitespace, ends with `():`

```python
def my_function():
  print("my_name")
# ❌ don't start function name with numbers.
# ❌ don't include whitespaces. Same as variable
```

#### Indentation

function has two spaces(one tab) under the function name. See above example.
Python is sensitive with whitespace. Make sure keep those rules, otherwise it will cause the error with your functions.

```python
def right_function():
  print("✅")
# prints check mark
def wrong_function():
print("❌")
# prints nothing
```

### Arguments (Parameters)

We already know the most used python function. That is `print()`
What we put inside of the `print()` is the argument of the function.

```python
def say_hello(params):
  print("hello" + params)

say_hello(args)
```

The **argument** is what we passing in to function, and the **parameters** are the placeholders which receives the data from the outside of the function.

- #### No arguments
  unlike `print()` to use function we need to **call** the function at the end.

```python
def say_my_name():
  print('Josh Bang')
  print('Lisa')
  print('Jenny')
  print('Rose')

say_my_name() # 👈 "call" function
# call the function with trailing ()
```

- #### One argument
  Function takes the argument inside of the parethesis `function(arg)`

```python
def say_my_name(name):
  print(name)

say_my_name("Bob")
```

- #### Multiple Arguments / default arguments

Function can take multiple arguments. Also we can set default arguments for the function.

```python
def greeting(name, greet='Hey Hey'):
  '''
  greeting takes 2 arguments, greet and name and it greets the user
  >>> greeting('aloha', 'John')

  "aloha John!"
  '''
  print(f'{greet} {name}!')

greeting('aloha', 'Jane')
greeting('Flash')
greeting('Bob', 'Hello')
```

Run the code to check the results.
`greeting('Flash')` doesn't have the greet argument, but because of the default value `greet='Hey Hey'` you should be able to see `"Hey Hey Flash!"`

- #### Named Arguments / positional arguments

Assume that we use the same function above. If we run `greeting('Hola', 'hola')` it will be very confusing. To avoid this, we can name the arguments

```python
# greeting('Hola', 'hola')
greeting(greet='Hola', name='Sancho')

'''
The result will be "Hola Sancho!"
'''
```

## Apply

Let's make a function to apply what we've learned so far.

Create a function that takes two numbers and sums two value

<details>
  <summary>Click me</summary>
  <div markdown="1">

```python
def sum(a, b):
  '''
  Takes 2 integers returns their sum
  '''
  return a + b

print(sum(1,3))
```

  </div>
</details>

### return

By far, we just print the result of the function. But what if we want to send the data outside of the function?

```python
def tax_cal(money):
  print(money * 0.38)

tax_cal(9999999)

def paid_tax(tax):
  print(f"Thanks for paying ${tax}.")

paid_tax(3799999.62)
```

![Alt text](</images/2023-02-27-python_02/Screen Shot 2023-02-27 at 11.01.22 PM.png>)

Do we want to grab the value of the `tax_cal(9999999)` from the terminal and paste in paid_tax again? That would be very inefficient.
To use `tax_cal(money)` again in a different function, we need to `return` a result instead of `print()`

```python
def tax_cal(money):
  return money * 0.38

def paid_tax(tax):
  print(f"Thanks for paying ${tax}.")

pay_tax = tax_cal(9999999)
paid_tax(pay_tax)
```
